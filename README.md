## A wrapping list of spans with a div to the right

This project is based on [react-list-vertical](https://github.com/mdoery/react-list-vertical). In that project, a list of names is displayed in a vertical column to the left of the screen.

This project adds a big div to the right of that column. It's used to display a video.
